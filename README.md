# ReduceNaturalScenes
 Uses physiological eye movements to create movies that mimic scene encoding by retinal neurons. Scenes can then be reduced to a low-dimensional space or turned into a high-dimensional metamer. Freedland & Rieke observe these altered movies encode similarly to the original natural image movie in parasol retinal ganglion cells.
