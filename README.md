# ReduceNaturalScenes
by J. Freedland, released 2021.

This package uses physiological eye movements to create movies that capture specific image patches encoded by retinal neurons. This package relies on the DOVES dataset. Please cite their paper as: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19228456/
 
Scenes can then be reduced to a low-dimensional space or turned into a high-dimensional metamer. Freedland & Rieke observe these altered movies encode similarly to the original natural image movie in parasol retinal ganglion cells.
